- CSS files can be added to app/assets/stylesheets. Any css file in the folder will be included automatically.

- Same thing with javascript. All .js files in the app/assets/javascript will be run for EVERY page.

- Put images in assets/images. An example on how to access the images is in index.html.erb.

- html files are located in the app/views folder. They are organized based on the controller. .erb means ruby code can be embeded inside the html.
