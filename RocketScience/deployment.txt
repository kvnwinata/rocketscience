locally:
- run'rails s'
- then check: localhost:3000
- you can leave this running and make changes. Refreshing the page will then apply the changes.
- Beware of caching. This doesn't happen very often but if you notice weird things it might be the cache.

on heroku:
- commit all changes
- push to heroku by: 'git push heroku master'
- check: rocketscienceink.herokuapp.com
